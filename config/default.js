 * This is the default configuration file.

 * on how to configure it.
 *
 * This file is intended for developers or deeper customizations.
 *
 * The configuration is based on `config` (https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config)
 * and it can be extended and overwritten in several ways as explained here (https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config/wiki/Configuration-Files)
 *
 * The quickest way to overwrite it with your own configuration is to create a `local.json`
 * file in the `/config` folder, as sibling of this file, and to override only the changed
 * properties.
